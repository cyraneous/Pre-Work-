    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
      Muse is a two-time Grammy Award-winning rock band formed in Teignmouth, Devon, England in 1994. The band includes Matt Bellamy (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dominic Howard (drums). The group began as a goth rock band called Rocket Baby Dolls. Their first show was a battle of the band's competition – in which they smashed all of their equipment – and surprisingly won. The band changed their name to Muse because they thought it looked good on a poster – and the town of Teignmouth was said to have a muse hovering over it because of the large number of bands it produced.
